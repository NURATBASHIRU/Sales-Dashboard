## Sales-Dashboard
### Project Overview
This analysis unviels the sales activity of a super store in the United States. The analysis focuses on the different product category, state region and customers that complete the sales cycle. After transforming the dataset,I caried our a comprehensive analysis on the varies variable and categories that make up the sale cycle. This led to the visualization created for the purpose of this research. The visuals indicate how each and every variable leds to the total sale and profit accumulated by the business. Firstly, I created a Key Performance Indicator(KPI) including a line chart that describes how the KPIs changed over time.
The KPIs include;
- Profit
- Sales
- Customers and Total Orders. This gives us clarity on the critical aspect of performance, allowing us to focus on the variables that really matters in this analysis.

I also created visualization for the following;
- Sales by State: Represented by a map.
- Sales by Customer Segment: Represented by a combo-column chart - the gradient bar depicts the profit made on each customer (compared to sales made).
- Sales by Product Sub-category: Represented by a combo chart - the gradient bar depicts the profit made on each product sub-category (compared to sales made).
- Top 10 Customers: Represented by a vertical bar chart.
- Lastly, Rating For Cuisine Types: This shows the relationship / pattern between each rating for each cuisine.

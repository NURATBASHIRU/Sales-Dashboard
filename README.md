## Sales-Dashboard
### Project Overview
This analysis unviels the sales activity of a super store in the United States. The analysis focuses on the different product category, state region and customers that complete the sales cycle. In this analysis, I developed visualization for each variable and indicate how it leads to the total sale and profit accumulated by the business. Firstly, I created a Key Performance Indicator(KPI)
The KPIs include;
- Profit
- Sales
- Customers and Total Orders. This gives us clarity on the critical aspect of performance, allowing us to focus on the variables that really matters in this analysis.

I also created visualization for the following;
- Sales by State: Represented by a map.
- Sales by Customer Segment: Represented by a column chart.
- Sales by Product Sub-category: Represented by a cumbo chart.
- Top 10 Customers: Represented by a vertical bar chart.
- Lastly, Rating For Cuisine Types: This shows the relationship / pattern between each rating for each cuisine.
